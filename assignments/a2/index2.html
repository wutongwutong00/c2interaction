    <h1>GERTRUDE<br>STEIN<br><i>ON</i> <br>PUNCTUATION</h1>
    </section>

    <section id="s1">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not. 
        Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. Of these the one but the first and the most 
        the completely most uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it 
        is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but 
        connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is evident that 
        is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question 
        is a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one 
        use the question mark. Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases 
        neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. 
        A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the 
        question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing. 
        Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively 
        revolting, and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also 
        quotation marks, they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or 
        the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a question what 
        is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began 
        writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation 
        points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but 
        not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.</p> <h3>1</h3> 
    </section>

    <section id="s2">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo there are the uninteresting things in 
            punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly 
        obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, 
        and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them.</p><h3>2</h3>
    </section>

    <section id="s3">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession. 
        Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case 
        apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without 
        it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel 
        myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not 
        like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word 
        and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from 
        time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. I cannot 
        positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in. </p><h3>3</h3>    
    </section>

    <section id="s4">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, commas, 
        colons, semi-colons and capitals and small letters.</p><h3>4</h3>    
    </section>

    <section id="s5">
        <h2>I HAVE HAD A LONG AND COMPLICATED LIFE WITH ALL THESE.</h2> 
    </section>
    
    <section id="s6">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLet us begin with these I use the least first and these are colons 
        and semi-colons, one might add to these commas.</p><h3>6</h3>     
    </section>

    <section id="s7">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, 
        I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the 
        necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do 
        with it, what had periods to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing 
        going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had colons 
        and semi-colons to do with it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with it.</p><h3>7</h3>    
    </section>

    <section id="s8">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhat had periods to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely 
        I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again 
        and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist. Beside 
        I had always like the look of periods and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep one 
        from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as 
        a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never stopped using them.</p><h3>8</h3>    
    </section>

    <section id="s9">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to 
        commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written 
        called Winning His Way, later I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about 
        three years ago periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own. They could begin to act as 
        they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing 
        with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used 
        and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a 
        life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do. Yes 
        you do feel what I mean.</p><h3>9</h3>    
    </section>

    <section id="s10">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPeriods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling 
        of their own a time of their own. And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself 
        in an infinite variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to periods so much so that as 
        I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.</p><h3>10</h3>    
    </section>
    
    <section id="s11">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a 
        comma, a colon or a semi-colon.</p><h3>11</h3>

    <section id="s12">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons 
        you can think of them as commas and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and 
        then using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself 
        never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their 
        own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. Semi-colons 
        and colons had for me from the first completely this character the character that a comma has and not the 
        character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them. But now dimly and definitely 
        I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the period and 
        so it might have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. I think however lively they are or 
        disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them. 
        They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. They really 
        have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the comma nature. And now what does a comma do and 
        what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.</p><h3>13</h3>

        <h2>what does a comma do.</h2>    
        </section>

    <section id="s15">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have refused them so often and left them out so much and did without 
        them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them 
        in or not but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them.</p><h3>15</h3>    
    </section>
    
    <section id="s16">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and 
        their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own 
        interest my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and 
        putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many 
        years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them 
        was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant.</p><h3>16</h3>

    <h4>“There’s another trouble with meaning. We’ve been taught to believe it comes near the end. As if the job of all 
        those sentences were to ferry us along to the place where meaning is enacted—to “the point,” Just before the conclusion, 
        Which restates “the point.” This is especially true in the school model of writing. Remember the papers you wrote? 
        Trying to save that one good idea till the very end? Hoping to create the illusion that it followed logically from 
        the previous paragraphs? You were stalling until you had ten pages. Much of what’s taught under the name of expository 
        writing could be called “The Anxiety of Sequence.” Its premise is this: To get where you’re going, you have to begin 
        in just the right place And take the proper path, Which depends on knowing where you plan to conclude. This is like 
        not knowing where to begin a journey Until you decide where you want it to end. Begin in the wrong place, make the 
        wrong turn, And there’s no getting where you want to go. Why not begin where you already are?”

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, 
        verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that 
        I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of 
        the active life of writing. </p><h3>17</h3>

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspComplications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always 
        liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence 
        and independence. You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading. 
        Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any 
        artificial aid to bring about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you see now why 
        I feel about the comma as I did and as I do.</p><h3>18</h3>

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut 
        the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool 
        so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what does a comma do, 
        a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. A long 
        complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, well at the 
        most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to 
        know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, 
        but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. 
        Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a 
        comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following 
        one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of 
        themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.</p><h3>22</h3>

        <h4>Exclamation points have been with us in their modern form for over 600 years, but several writers and commentators 
        have warned that using them is more than a failure of style—it’s also a sign of bad taste, and maybe even poor character. 
        “An exclamation point is like laughing at your own joke,” said F. Scott Fitzgerald. David Marsh, who edits the style guide 
        for the British newspaper The Guardian, says something similar: when a newspaper uses an exclamation point in a headline, 
        it invariably means, “Look, we’ve written something funny.” The physician and man of letters Lewis Thomas wrote that seeing 
        exclamation points “is like being forced to watch someone else’s small child jumping up and down crazily in the center of 
        the living room shouting to attract attention.” If a sentence has an important point to make, Thomas concluded, it doesn’t 
        need a mark to point it out.</h4>
