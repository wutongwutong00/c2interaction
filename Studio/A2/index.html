    <!-- <h1 class="afterpunctuation">

    </h1> -->

    <p id="appear">There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not. 
        Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. Of these the one but the first and the most 
        the completely most uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it 
        is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but 
        connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. It is evident that 
        is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question 
        is a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one 
        use the question mark. Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases 
        neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. 
        A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the 
        question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing. 
        Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively 
        revolting, and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also 
        quotation marks, they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or 
        the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a question what 
        is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began 
        writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation 
        points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but 
        not at any rate anybody can and does <span id="text">see it that way.</span></p>

    <p id="appear">So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly 
        obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, 
        and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them. </p>

    <p>One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession. 
        Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive 
        case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to 
        do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to 
        time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. I 
        absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental 
        but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At 
        least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes 
        it has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in. </p>

    <p>So now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, commas, colons, semi-colons and capitals and 
        small letters. </p>
            
    <p>I have had a long and complicated life with all these.</p>
            
    <p>Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are colons and semi-colons, one might add to these commas.</p>

    <p>When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do feel that it should go 
        on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should 
        go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, what had periods 
        to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which 
        was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons 
        to do with it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with it.</p>

    <p>What had periods to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, 
        physically one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime 
        and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist. Beside I had always like 
        the look of periods and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, 
        it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly 
        natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never stopped using them.</p>

    <p>Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things 
        in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His
         Way, later I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years 
         ago periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own. They could begin to act as 
         they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s 
         writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they 
         could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in 
         this way to have a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons 
         and semi-colons do. Yes you do feel what I mean.</p>

    <p>Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their 
        own. And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety
        that is the reason that I have always remained true to periods so much so that as I say recently I 
        have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.</p>

    <p>You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon or a semi-colon.</p>

    <p>There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas 
        and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using them can 
        make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have, 
        I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own 
        they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. 
        Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character the character that a 
        comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used 
        them. But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them 
        something of the character of the period and so it might have been an adventure to use them. 
        I really do not think so. I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely 
        more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them. They are more powerful 
        more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. They really have 
        within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the comma nature. And now what does a 
        comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.</p>

    <h3>“We forget something fundamental as we read: Every sentence could have been otherwise but isn't. 
        We can't see all the decisions that led to the final shape of the sentence. But we can see the 
        residue of those decisions.”

        ― Verlyn Klinkenborg, Several Short Sentences About Writing</h3>


    <p>What does a comma do.</p>

    <p>I have refused them so often and left them out so much and did without them so continually that 
        I have come finally to be indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not 
        but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them.</p>

    <p>As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, 
        it is a way of replacing one’s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest 
        my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and 
        putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me 
        for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to 
        them, the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and 
        what I felt and what I meant.</p>

    <h3>“There’s another trouble with meaning. We’ve been taught to believe it comes near the end. As 
        if the job of all those sentences were to ferry us along to the place where meaning is enacted—to 
        “the point,” Just before the conclusion, Which restates “the point.” This is especially true in 
        the school model of writing. Remember the papers you wrote? Trying to save that one good idea 
        till the very end? Hoping to create the illusion that it followed logically from the previous paragraphs? 
        You were stalling until you had ten pages. Much of what’s taught under the name of expository writing 
        could be called “The Anxiety of Sequence.” Its premise is this: To get where you’re going, you have 
        to begin in just the right place And take the proper path, Which depends on knowing where you plan 
        to conclude. This is like not knowing where to begin a journey Until you decide where you want it 
        to end. Begin in the wrong place, make the wrong turn, And there’s no getting where you want to go. 
        Why not begin where you already are?”

        ― Verlyn Klinkenborg, Several Short Sentences About Writing</h3>

    <p>When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active present verbs 
        with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize 
        verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of 
        the active life of writing. </p>

    <p>Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial 
        clauses. I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. 
        You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading. 
        Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication 
        would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about 
        that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do.</p>

    <p>Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I mean.</p>

    <p>When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least of anybody 
        feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels 
        who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what does a comma do, a comma 
        does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. A long 
        complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, 
        well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to 
        take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether 
        has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why 
        emphasize one breath rather than another breath. Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt 
        that about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated 
        the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the 
        more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves 
        by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.</p>

    <p>So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different but more so and 
        later I will go into that. But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.</p>
