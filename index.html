    <h1>About Rice</h1>
   <!-- Introduction to topic, first sentence bold to give hierarchy -->
    <h4>Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly Oryza glaberrima (African rice).</h4>
   
     <!-- First paragrpah -->
    <p>The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, 
        although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.
<br><br>
        As a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human 
        population,
          <!-- Superscript for references -->
        <sup>[Liu 1]</sup> especially in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide 
        production, after sugarcane and maize.<sup>[1]</sup> Since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used for purposes 
        other than human consumption, rice is the most important food crop with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake,
         providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans.<sup>[2]</sup> There are many varieties of rice and 
         culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.
        
        <br><br>
        The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. 
        This simple method requires sound irrigation planning but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants 
        that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice,
        all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different 
        approach for fertilizing the soil.
        <br><br>
         Rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial 
             and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years.<sup>[3]</sup> Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions 
             with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, 
             rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling 
             terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade 
             and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide. Production and consumption of rice is estimated
              to have been responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010.</p>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>The rice plant can grow to 1–1.8 m (3–6 ft) tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility. It has long, 
    slender leaves 50–100 cm (20–40 in) long and 2–2.5 cm (3⁄4–1 in) broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are produced in a 
    branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30–50 cm (12–20 in) long. The edible seed is a grain (caryopsis) 5–12 mm 
    (3⁄16–15⁄32 in) long and 2–3 mm (3⁄32–1⁄8 in) thick.</p>
