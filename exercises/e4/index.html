    Why Elizabeth Holmes, the former biotech entrepreneur who has 
    fallen out of public favor? I mean, yes, she might be convicted 
    of criminal fraud, but let's be real here. She should've been 
    convicted for misleading the public and using faulty machines 
    on the public, and not for investor fraud. I mean the whole idea 
    of investor fraud is kind of strange to be honest. Especiallty 
    here, all these rich men could've just done a background. I mean, 
    aren't you supposed to research the things you invest in? But how 
    would I know? I'm just some lousy art student and not a venture capitalist.

    I definitely am afraid of needles. It's the only thing that actually scares me.

    The right to protect the health and well-being of every person, of those we love, is a basic human right.
    
    We know more about our credit cards than we know about our bodies.
    
    This is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world. 
    
    You’ll get knocked down over and over and over again, and you get back up.
    
    I know that we made mistakes.
    
    When you find what you love, you do it. That’s it.
    
    I believe in the unlimited power of women in the context of science and engineering.
    
    I think that the minute that you have a backup plan, you've admitted that you're not going to succeed.
